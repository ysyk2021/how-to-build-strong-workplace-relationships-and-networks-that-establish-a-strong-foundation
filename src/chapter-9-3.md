5. Build relationships: Use technology to build relationships by engaging in conversations, sharing knowledge and expertise, and providing support to others.
6. Balance virtual and face-to-face communication: While technology can enhance communication and collaboration, it is essential to balance virtual and face-to-face communication. Make an effort to meet with colleagues in person when possible to build stronger relationships and foster better collaboration.
